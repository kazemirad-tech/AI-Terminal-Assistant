# 🏗️ Architecture Overview

## 🧠 Core Concept
The assistant operates locally within Linux terminals, translating natural language into secure shell commands—without relying on external tools or cloud APIs.

## 🧩 Modules
- **Parser**: Translates user input into structured command trees
- **Executor**: Runs commands in a sandboxed, auditable environment
- **Logger**: Records usage, errors, and system feedback securely

## 🔐 Security Design
- 100% local execution (no external API calls)
- Sandboxing and permission control
- Optional encryption for logs and audit trails

## 📈 Scalability
Built with modularity in mind—supports plugin extensions for various terminal environments (e.g., Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora), and organizational workflows.
